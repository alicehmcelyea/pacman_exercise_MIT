## PacMan Game

This code creates a simple game that features Pac-Man moving across a game container and collecting dots. The game is built using JavaScript and HTML, and is initialized when the start button is clicked. The game container is selected using the querySelector() method, and Pac-Man and the dots are created using the createElement() method. The Pac-Man images are stored in an array, and the game uses setInterval() to animate Pac-Man's movement across the container, switching between the two images in the array to create the illusion of motion. The game also detects collisions between Pac-Man and the dots, removing the dots from the container and adding points to the player's score. The game continues until all of the dots have been collected or until Pac-Man collides with a wall.


## Roadmaps

There are several ways to improve this game, here are a few: 

Add power-ups that temporarily give Pac-Man invincibility, make him move faster, or make him grow in size and eat dots faster.

Add different game modes: You could add different game modes that change the gameplay, such as a time-based mode where you have to eat as many dots as possible within a certain amount of time, or a mode where you have to avoid ghosts as well as eat dots.

Add boss battles: You could add boss battles where Pac-Man has to defeat a particularly tough ghost by eating special power pellets or using other special abilities.

Add multiplayer mode: You could add a multiplayer mode where two or more players can compete against each other to eat the most dots and avoid the ghosts.

Add obstacles: You could add obstacles that Pac-Man has to avoid, such as moving walls or barriers that he can only pass through at certain times.

Add achievements and rewards: You could add achievements for completing certain challenges, such as eating a certain number of dots in a row, and offer rewards like special power-ups or new skins for Pac-Man.

Add different environments: You could add different environments that change the look and feel of the game, such as a spooky haunted house or a futuristic cityscape.
